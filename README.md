# Geometry Calculator
The "Geometry Calculator" is a Java program designed to provide a versatile tool for calculating the areas of various geometric shapes. The program offers a user-friendly menu with options to calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, or triangle, along with an option to exit the program. Upon execution, the user is prompted to choose an operation by entering a corresponding number. Depending on the choice, the program prompts the user to input the required parameters, such as radius, length, width, base, and height. The "Demo" class interacts with the user through the console and employs the "Geometry" class to perform the area calculations. The code employs a do-while loop to facilitate repeated calculations based on user preference. In case of an invalid input, the program offers appropriate error messages. The program maintains user engagement by continuously prompting for further calculations until the user chooses to exit. This project effectively showcases the use of Java's core concepts like conditional statements, user input handling, and object-oriented programming to create an interactive geometry calculator
